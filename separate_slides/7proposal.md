# Introduction
- The idea of the project is to develop a House Management System based on Java SpringMVC. We will utilize two different databases to develop the system. One database is MySQL which is based on SQL, and the other one is MongoDB based on No-SQL. In the end, we will compare two databases performance, website performance and etc.

- In the House Management system, there are different users, such as students and house management staff. Students can make a room and parking slot application, and staff can process students appliation in the system.

- We will develop this website using Java with SpingMVC + Hibernate based on two different databases, and analyse the whole web development process using Agile Development.

- In the end, we plan to compare two approaches with development efficiency, the website performance, the difference of development, testing and deployment, and etc.

# Goals
1. Analyse the difference, advantages and disadvantages of two approaches by comparing them when we are using both language to do the thing..
2. Implement software engineering knowledge(Agile Development) into the practical project.
3. Practice DevOps model into our project and experience the whole process of software development life cycle. 
4. Probably we could see some differences in software cycles of the two different languages after we finish the projects. Developers would have a more clear mind to choose the language for their project according the characteristics of their projects.

#SpringMVC SQL vs. NoSQL
SpringMVC:

- ORM with Tools, Hibernate

- Mature platform with extensive community

SQL vs. NoSQL:
