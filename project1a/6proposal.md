# Introduction
- The idea of this project is to develop a House Management System using Java SPringMVC and two different databases. One database is MySQL with SQL, and the other one is MongoDB with No-SQL. We will compare two databases performance in the house management system using different test.

- In the House Management system, there are different users, such as students, house management staff. Students can make a room application, and staff can process students appliation in the system.

- We will compare two databases performance and get the performance result of two databases via JUnit Test, System Test and Integration Test.

# Project Goals
1. Analyse the difference, advantages and disadvantages of two approaches by comparing them when we are using both language to do the thing..
2. Implement software engineering knowledge(Agile Development) into the practical project.
3. Practice DevOps model into our project and experience the whole process of software development life cycle. 
4. Probably we could see some differences in software cycles of the two different languages after we finish the projects. Developers would have a more clear mind to choose the language for their project according the characteristics of their projects.

#SpringMVC SQL vs. NoSQL
SpringMVC:
