- Choose MySQL(SQL) and MongoDB(NoSQL) to test their single thread performance.
- See the performance of Insertion, FindbyID, Deletion for MySQL and MongoDB.

   <li> Fixed <u>number</u> of records to be added to the two databases.

 - Insertion 
   - MongoDB's Insertion performance is better than MySQL's insertion performance in single thread.
 - Find
   - Method 1: 
   - MySQL is faster than MongoDB in findbyID an increasing number of records in database with a fixed number of records.  
   - Method 2:
   - MysQL is faster than MongoDB in findbyID a fixed number of records from databases with a varied number of records.
<<<<<<< HEAD
   - The number of records in databases can't clearly affect findbyID performance of MySQL and MongoDB.

 - Delete
   - Method 1:
   - MongoDB is faster than MySQL in deletion different number of records from databases with fixed number of records(200000). 
   - Method 2ï¼š
   - MongoDB is faster than MySQL in deletion the same number of records (5000) from databases with varied number of records.
   - The number of records in databases affects the deletion performance of MySQL, and has little affection on the deletion performance of MongoDB.
