# Introduction
- The idea of the project is to develop an online system for university housing using two popular database(SQL / MongoDB).
In the online system, there will be different access control restriction based on the roles of students, visitors, and staff.

- We will develop this website using Java with SpingMVC + Hibernate based on DevOps model, and analyse the whole web development process using Agile Development.

- In the end, we plan to compare two database with development efficiency, the website performance, the difference of development, testing and deployment, and etc. 

# System Roles
1. A professor can see all questions and answers related to any topic in any course (even if he/she is not the professor for that course) at all times.
2. A TA can only see questions and answers that have been assigned as part of homework exercises for the course that they are TA in at any time after it a homework is composed (even before the submission opens). However, TAs cannot make changes to homeworks at any time.
3. Both instructors and TAs can see the class roll and homework attempts and grades of all students.
4. A student can takes homeworks and views scores of courses.

# Goals
1. Analyse the difference, advantages and disadvantages of two database.
2. Implement software engineering knowledge(Agile Development) into the practical project.
3. Practice DevOps model into our project and experience the whole process of software development life cycle. 
4. Probably we could see some differences of the two database after we finish the projects. Developers would have a more clear mind to choose the database for their project according the characteristics of their projects.

#SQL VS. MongoDB
SQL:

- Enterprise application

- ORM with Tools, Hibernate

- Mature platform with extensive community

MongoDB:

- Light weight application

- Easy with data persistence

- Dynamic and User friendly
