# Multi-Thread Performance
- Little improvement on time factors in insertion and deletion in Mongo like NoSQL database on a single instance has
- Signficant influence on query performance, the performance could be improved by at least 50%
- More improvement could be achieved by utilizing expanded scale of cluster servers
