#Project Proposal
- Introduction
- Business Flow
- Project Goals
- Approaches Comparison
- Development Cycle

# Introduction
- The idea of the project is to develop a House Management System based on Java SpringMVC. We will utilize two different databases to develop the system. One database is MySQL which is based on SQL, and the other one is MongoDB based on No-SQL. In the end, we will compare two databases performance using JUnit Test, System Test and Integration Test.

- In the House Management system, there are different users, such as students, house management staff. Students can make a room application, and staff can process students appliation in the system.

- We will develop this website using Java with SpingMVC based on two different databases, compare two databases performance and use different testing methods to get the performance result of two databases.

# Goals
1. Analyse the difference, advantages and disadvantages of two approaches by comparing them when we are using both language to do the thing..
2. Implement software engineering knowledge(Agile Development) into the practical project.
3. Practice DevOps model into our project and experience the whole process of software development life cycle. 
4. Probably we could see some differences in software cycles of the two different languages after we finish the projects. Developers would have a more clear mind to choose the language for their project according the characteristics of their projects.

#SpringMVC SQL vs. NoSQL
SpringMVC:

- Enterprise application

- ORM with Tools, Hibernate

- Mature platform with extensive community

SQL vs. NoSQL:

- MySQL is SQL database.

- MongoDB is NoSQL database.
