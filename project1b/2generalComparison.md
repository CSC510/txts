Differences                                 MySQL                                                   MongoDB
-----------------------------------     --------------------------------------------------------    -----------------------------------------------------------------
Memory Usage                             reasonable memory usage                                    Need enough memory to keep efficient
Scalability                                     hard to scale                                       easy to scale
Complex query performance                 unsatisfying complex query performance                    handle more complicated queries faster
Single thread VS. Multiple thread         vary with different operations                            no apparent advantage over 4 threads
Data association                          support dynamic SQL query like join tables                support embedded collections
Security                                  give a quite safe performance                             still have some security issues
Supports transactions                      supports for atomic transactions                         does not support transactions but single operations are atomic
Data manipulation                          Specific language using Select, Insert, and Update       Through object-oriented APIs
Consistency                                Can be configured for strong consistency                 Depends on product
